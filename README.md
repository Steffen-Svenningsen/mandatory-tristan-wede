# Mandatory Tristan Wede

A simple school project: Being supplied with assets (images, icons etc.), I've created the HTML and CSS for a simple responsive website, transforming images received from the teacher into a functional static site.

I've connected the repo to Vercel to host the website, so you can [visit the website here.](https://mandatory-tristan-wede.vercel.app/)
